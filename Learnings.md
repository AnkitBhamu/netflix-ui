1. React batches the changes i.e it only re renders after all the changes to the state variables are made through event handlers or statechngers

2. usestate scans a queue of updates to changes the state value finally.

3. in react strict mode two times the intitial rendering happens.

<!-- *******IMPORTANT THING -->

4. There are two scripts in js and one is CommonJs in which we can use only require in importing things but in ECMA script import can be used , which to use must be specified im package.json file which node by default reads.

5. for common js we use module.exports and for ECMA we use only export {var name};

6. require are syncronous but import are not sync
